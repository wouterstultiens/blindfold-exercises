# BlindfoldExercises UX Research Method

## Goal
Build a defensible, evidence-backed target design spec for a premium blindfold chess trainer optimized for serious improvers (5-60 min/day), while keeping current app scope to:
- `square_color`
- `puzzle_recall`

## Research Question
What interaction, information, and visual design decisions measurably improve:
- learning efficiency (retention, transfer, consistency)
- session completion and repeat use
- clarity and confidence during blindfold-style training
- accessibility and mobile ergonomics

## Evidence Hierarchy
Use sources in this order:

1. Tier A: Standards and platform guidance
- W3C WCAG/WAI/APG, platform accessibility guidance, web performance standards.

2. Tier B: Peer-reviewed research
- memory, learning science, expertise development, chess cognition, motivation.

3. Tier C: High-signal UX research
- established UX organizations with explicit methods and long-running evidence bases.

4. Tier D: Product benchmark evidence
- official product docs/help content and observable product behavior.

## Inclusion Rules
A source is included only if it has:
- clear provenance (standard body, peer-reviewed venue, or official product doc)
- direct relevance to chess training UX, mobile interaction, or learning behavior
- actionable implication for this app

## Exclusion Rules
Exclude sources that are:
- trend/opinion content without testable guidance
- thin secondary summaries when primary source is available
- low-credibility SEO content, generic "best practices" without evidence

## Synthesis Pipeline
1. Extract finding
- one concrete claim only.

2. Convert to product rule
- translate claim into app-specific rule.

3. Attach acceptance signal
- define a measurable UX/test signal.

4. Record confidence
- High: standards or replicated findings
- Medium: strong but context-sensitive evidence
- Low: directional benchmark insight

## Conflict Handling
When sources conflict:
1. Prefer higher-tier evidence.
2. If same tier, prefer recency and methodological strength.
3. Keep minority view as "context risk" note.

## Output Contract (for all docs)
Each major recommendation must map:

`Principle -> Evidence -> Product Rule -> UI Implication -> Acceptance Signal`

## Maintenance
- Update corpus quarterly or when major standards/platform updates ship.
- Re-validate target UX spec when new drills are added beyond current 2-drill scope.
- Keep docs concise and implementation-facing, not essay-style.
